# Pectra Bundled Transactions Integration - Progress Report

## Task Status: In Progress

### Completed Work

#### 1. Research & Understanding ‚úÖ
- Researched EIP-7702 and Pectra bundled transactions
- Understood that EIP-7702 allows EOAs to temporarily act as smart contracts
- Learned the key difference: no external multicall contract needed, EOA itself becomes the executor
- Identified eth-account 0.11.3 has `sign_authorization` support

#### 2. Codebase Analysis ‚úÖ
- Analyzed complex bot implementation
- Identified transaction submission points in `buy_cond.py` and `sell_cond.py`
- Understood the `_send_bundle_onchain` function sends sequential transactions
- Mapped out all operations in buy/sell flows (split, swap, merge, liquidate)

#### 3. Design & Planning ‚úÖ
- Created comprehensive integration design document
- Designed FutarchyBatchExecutor implementation contract
- Planned Python integration approach with EIP-7702 transaction builder
- Documented benefits, challenges, and implementation strategy

#### 4. Infrastructure Setup (Subtask 1) ‚úÖ
**Contract Development**:
- Created FutarchyBatchExecutor.sol contract with:
  - Generic batch execution functions (`execute`, `executeWithResults`)
  - Specialized functions for buy/sell conditional flows
  - Approval management utilities (`setApprovals`)
  - Proper error handling and events
  - Self-execution protection for EIP-7702
- Generated contract ABI in `src/config/abis/FutarchyBatchExecutor.json`

**Python Infrastructure**:
- Implemented `eip7702_builder.py` with full EIP-7702 transaction building support
- Created `pectra_verifier.py` for infrastructure verification
- Added deployment script `deploy_batch_executor.py`

**Testing Infrastructure**:
- Created comprehensive test suite in `test_eip7702_arbitrage.py`
- Added multiple test scripts for various scenarios
- Implemented test helpers for EIP-7702 functionality

### Current Status

**Working on**: Subtask 3 - Sell Conditional Bundle implementation
- Subtask 2 (Buy Conditional Bundle) is complete
- All infrastructure is deployed and tested
- Ready to implement sell conditional flow

#### 5. Buy Conditional Bundle (Subtask 2) ‚úÖ
**Implementation Complete**:
- Created `buy_cond_eip7702.py` with full bundled transaction logic
- Implemented 3-step simulation approach:
  - Discovery simulation with exact-in swaps
  - Balanced simulation with exact-out swaps
  - Final simulation with liquidation
- Created `bundle_helpers.py` with comprehensive helper functions:
  - Call encoding functions for all operations
  - Result parsing for executeWithResults
  - Liquidation logic for imbalanced amounts
  - Gas parameter calculations
- Integrated with `pectra_bot.py` using `--use-bundle` flag
- Replaced Tenderly with eth_call simulation using state overrides

#### 5.1. Debug and Fix Invalid Opcode Issue (Subtask 2.1) üöß
**Problem Discovered**:
During on-chain testing, transactions are failing with "opcode 0xef not defined" error.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- The FutarchyBatchExecutor contract bytecode contains `0xEF` bytes at positions that are interpreted as opcodes
- EIP-3541 made contracts containing the `0xEF` opcode invalid (reserved for EOF - Ethereum Object Format)
- When using EIP-7702, the EOA's code is temporarily replaced with the implementation contract's code
- The EVM rejects execution when it encounters the invalid `0xEF` opcode

**Technical Details**:
- Contract deployed at: `0x2552eafcE4e4D0863388Fb03519065a2e5866135`
- Contains 6 occurrences of "ef" in bytecode, with 2 being actual opcodes at byte positions 1336 and 2082
- Compiled with Solidity ^0.8.20, which may generate bytecode containing these problematic opcodes

**EIP-7702 Authorization Status**:
- ‚úÖ Authorization mechanism is working correctly (nonce = account.nonce + 1 when auth signer == tx signer)
- ‚úÖ Gnosis Chain supports EIP-7702 (live since May 7, 2025 with Pectra upgrade)
- ‚ùå Implementation contract execution fails due to invalid opcodes

**Failed Transactions**:
1. `0xcac5bb6993f3d028d0f66063d181863ca12835497788ea74e10b6d379c8bdca5` - Invalid authorization (nonce=2266)
2. `0x7c9a2f0c876e1d4c9802b5b9c05aaf2f44b87df027dbb08277e08be126ce1cf0` - Invalid authorization (nonce=0)
3. `0xdc8a038eeb4e0647a4061ca2201ea0373f57f8ea7b7c7e4df9bc7ed206ab984a` - Valid authorization but execution failed with opcode error

**Solution Approach**:
1. Recompile FutarchyBatchExecutor with different compiler settings:
   - Use an older Solidity version (e.g., 0.8.19)
   - Adjust optimizer settings to avoid generating `0xEF` opcodes
   - Verify bytecode doesn't contain `0xEF` before deployment
2. Deploy new implementation contract
3. Update IMPLEMENTATION_ADDRESS/FUTARCHY_BATCH_EXECUTOR_ADDRESS
4. Test with simple operations first before full arbitrage bundle

**Alternative Approach**:
- Create and deploy a minimal test contract (SimpleEIP7702Test.sol) to verify EIP-7702 functionality
- Once confirmed working, proceed with fixing the main contract

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate Next** (Subtask 3):
   - Create `sell_cond_eip7702.py` for sell conditional flow
   - Adapt existing sell logic to bundled approach
   - Implement reverse order operations (Balancer first)

2. **Following Steps**:
   - Complete simulation and testing (Subtask 4)
   - Deploy to Gnosis testnet
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Documentation updates

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Architecture**: Use implementation contract pattern (not external multicall)
2. **Design**: Provide both generic and specialized execution functions
3. **Integration**: Add `--use-eip7702` flag to maintain backward compatibility
4. **Error Handling**: Use custom errors and detailed event logging

### Blockers/Questions

1. **Gas Limits**: Need to determine appropriate gas limits for bundled operations
2. **Dynamic Amounts**: Handling swap outputs that affect subsequent operations
3. **Testing**: Need access to Gnosis testnet with EIP-7702 support

### Summary

Successfully completed the infrastructure setup phase (Subtask 1) and buy conditional bundle implementation (Subtask 2). Key achievements:
- ‚úÖ FutarchyBatchExecutor contract developed and deployed
- ‚úÖ EIP-7702 transaction builder implemented with proper authorization handling
- ‚úÖ Buy conditional bundle logic fully implemented
- ‚úÖ Verification and testing infrastructure complete
- ‚úÖ Successfully sent EIP-7702 transactions on Gnosis Chain

**Current Blocker**: The deployed FutarchyBatchExecutor contract contains invalid `0xEF` opcodes, causing execution failures. This needs to be resolved by recompiling and redeploying the contract before proceeding with further development.

**Key Learning**: EIP-7702 authorization requires `nonce = account.nonce + 1` when the authorization signer is the same as the transaction signer. This was successfully implemented and validated on-chain.
