# Pectra Bundled Transactions Integration - Progress Report

## Task Status: In Progress

### Completed Work

#### 1. Research & Understanding ‚úÖ
- Researched EIP-7702 and Pectra bundled transactions
- Understood that EIP-7702 allows EOAs to temporarily act as smart contracts
- Learned the key difference: no external multicall contract needed, EOA itself becomes the executor
- Identified eth-account 0.11.3 has `sign_authorization` support

#### 2. Codebase Analysis ‚úÖ
- Analyzed complex bot implementation
- Identified transaction submission points in `buy_cond.py` and `sell_cond.py`
- Understood the `_send_bundle_onchain` function sends sequential transactions
- Mapped out all operations in buy/sell flows (split, swap, merge, liquidate)

#### 3. Design & Planning ‚úÖ
- Created comprehensive integration design document
- Designed FutarchyBatchExecutor implementation contract
- Planned Python integration approach with EIP-7702 transaction builder
- Documented benefits, challenges, and implementation strategy

#### 4. Implementation Started üîÑ
- Created initial FutarchyBatchExecutor.sol contract with:
  - Generic batch execution functions
  - Specialized functions for buy/sell conditional flows
  - Approval management utilities
  - Proper error handling and events
- Created detailed implementation plan with security considerations

### Current Status

**Working on**: Implementation contract design
- Just completed the initial Solidity contract
- Created detailed plan for advanced features (dynamic amounts, conditional execution)
- Ready to proceed with Python integration utilities

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate Next**:
   - Create EIP-7702 transaction builder in Python
   - Implement call encoding utilities for all operations
   - Create modified buy/sell functions using bundled transactions

2. **Following Steps**:
   - Test implementation contract on local fork
   - Deploy to Gnosis testnet
   - Integrate with complex bot
   - Performance testing and optimization

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Architecture**: Use implementation contract pattern (not external multicall)
2. **Design**: Provide both generic and specialized execution functions
3. **Integration**: Add `--use-eip7702` flag to maintain backward compatibility
4. **Error Handling**: Use custom errors and detailed event logging

### Blockers/Questions

1. **Gas Limits**: Need to determine appropriate gas limits for bundled operations
2. **Dynamic Amounts**: Handling swap outputs that affect subsequent operations
3. **Testing**: Need access to Gnosis testnet with EIP-7702 support

### Files Created/Modified

**Created**:
- `/contracts/FutarchyBatchExecutor.sol` - Implementation contract
- `/.claude/tasks/pectra-bundled-transactions/onboarding.md` - Initial research
- `/.claude/tasks/pectra-bundled-transactions/onboarding-summary.md` - Summary
- `/.claude/tasks/pectra-bundled-transactions/eip7702-integration-design.md` - Design doc
- `/.claude/tasks/pectra-bundled-transactions/implementation-contract-plan.md` - Contract plan

**To Be Created**:
- `src/helpers/eip7702_builder.py` - Transaction builder utilities
- `src/arbitrage_commands/buy_cond_eip7702.py` - Modified buy function
- `src/arbitrage_commands/sell_cond_eip7702.py` - Modified sell function

**To Be Modified**:
- `src/arbitrage_commands/complex_bot.py` - Add EIP-7702 support

### Time Estimate

- Research & Planning: ‚úÖ Complete (4 hours)
- Implementation Contract: üîÑ In Progress (2 hours done, 2-3 hours remaining)
- Python Integration: ‚è≥ Not Started (4-6 hours estimated)
- Testing & Debugging: ‚è≥ Not Started (3-4 hours estimated)
- Total Progress: ~25% complete

### Summary

Successfully completed the research and design phase. Created the initial implementation contract and have a clear plan for Python integration. Ready to proceed with building the EIP-7702 transaction utilities and integrating with the complex bot. The architecture is well-understood and documented.
