# Pectra Bundled Transactions Integration - Progress Report

## Task Status: In Progress

### Completed Work

#### 1. Research & Understanding ✅
- Researched EIP-7702 and Pectra bundled transactions
- Understood that EIP-7702 allows EOAs to temporarily act as smart contracts
- Learned the key difference: no external multicall contract needed, EOA itself becomes the executor
- Identified eth-account 0.11.3 has `sign_authorization` support

#### 2. Codebase Analysis ✅
- Analyzed complex bot implementation
- Identified transaction submission points in `buy_cond.py` and `sell_cond.py`
- Understood the `_send_bundle_onchain` function sends sequential transactions
- Mapped out all operations in buy/sell flows (split, swap, merge, liquidate)

#### 3. Design & Planning ✅
- Created comprehensive integration design document
- Designed FutarchyBatchExecutor implementation contract
- Planned Python integration approach with EIP-7702 transaction builder
- Documented benefits, challenges, and implementation strategy

#### 4. Infrastructure Setup (Subtask 1) ✅
**Contract Development**:
- Created FutarchyBatchExecutor.sol contract with:
  - Generic batch execution functions (`execute`, `executeWithResults`)
  - Specialized functions for buy/sell conditional flows
  - Approval management utilities (`setApprovals`)
  - Proper error handling and events
  - Self-execution protection for EIP-7702
- Generated contract ABI in `src/config/abis/FutarchyBatchExecutor.json`

**Python Infrastructure**:
- Implemented `eip7702_builder.py` with full EIP-7702 transaction building support
- Created `pectra_verifier.py` for infrastructure verification
- Added deployment script `deploy_batch_executor.py`

**Testing Infrastructure**:
- Created comprehensive test suite in `test_eip7702_arbitrage.py`
- Added multiple test scripts for various scenarios
- Implemented test helpers for EIP-7702 functionality

### Current Status

**Working on**: Completing infrastructure deployment
- Contract is ready for deployment
- Python infrastructure is implemented
- Verification tools are in place
- Ready to proceed with buy/sell conditional bundle implementation

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate Next**:
   - Create EIP-7702 transaction builder in Python
   - Implement call encoding utilities for all operations
   - Create modified buy/sell functions using bundled transactions

2. **Following Steps**:
   - Test implementation contract on local fork
   - Deploy to Gnosis testnet
   - Integrate with complex bot
   - Performance testing and optimization

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Architecture**: Use implementation contract pattern (not external multicall)
2. **Design**: Provide both generic and specialized execution functions
3. **Integration**: Add `--use-eip7702` flag to maintain backward compatibility
4. **Error Handling**: Use custom errors and detailed event logging

### Blockers/Questions

1. **Gas Limits**: Need to determine appropriate gas limits for bundled operations
2. **Dynamic Amounts**: Handling swap outputs that affect subsequent operations
3. **Testing**: Need access to Gnosis testnet with EIP-7702 support

  - Contract Development: ✅ Complete
  - Python Infrastructure: ✅ Complete
  - Testing Infrastructure: ✅ Complete
- Buy Conditional Bundle (Subtask 2): ⏳ Not Started (3-4 hours estimated)
- Sell Conditional Bundle (Subtask 3): ⏳ Not Started (3-4 hours estimated)
- Simulation & Testing (Subtask 4): ⏳ Not Started (2-3 hours estimated)
- Bot Integration (Subtask 5): ⏳ Not Started (2-3 hours estimated)
- Total Progress: ~40% complete

### Summary

Successfully completed the infrastructure setup phase (Subtask 1). All foundational components are in place:
- FutarchyBatchExecutor contract is developed and ready for deployment
- EIP-7702 transaction builder is implemented in Python
- Verification and testing infrastructure is complete
- Contract ABI and deployment scripts are ready

The project is now ready to proceed with implementing the buy and sell conditional bundle functions that will leverage this infrastructure for atomic arbitrage execution.
