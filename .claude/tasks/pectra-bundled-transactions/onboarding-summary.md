# EIP-7702 Integration Onboarding Summary

## Task Understanding
Modify the complex bot to use EIP-7702 (Pectra bundled transactions) for atomic execution of all arbitrage operations in a single transaction.

## Key Learnings

### 1. Current Architecture
- Complex bot executes multiple sequential transactions for arbitrage
- Uses `_send_bundle_onchain` to send transactions with consecutive nonces
- Each transaction waits for confirmation before proceeding
- Operations include: split, swap, merge, liquidate, and final swap

### 2. EIP-7702 Fundamentals
- New transaction type (type 4) that allows EOAs to temporarily act as smart contracts
- EOA signs an authorization to delegate to an implementation contract
- Transaction is sent to the EOA's own address (not an external contract)
- Maintains proper `msg.sender` context for all operations

### 3. Implementation Strategy
- Deploy a `FutarchyBatchExecutor` contract with batching logic
- Build all operations as a single array of calls
- Use EIP-7702 transaction format with authorization
- Execute all operations atomically in one transaction

### 4. Technical Requirements
- eth-account 0.11.3 (installed) ✓ - supports `sign_authorization`
- web3.py 6.11.1 (installed) ✓
- Implementation contract deployment on Gnosis Chain
- EIP-7702 transaction builder utilities

## Benefits of This Approach
1. **Atomicity**: All operations succeed or fail together
2. **Gas Efficiency**: Single transaction overhead instead of 5-6 transactions
3. **MEV Protection**: No opportunity to sandwich between operations
4. **Simplified Logic**: No need to track intermediate states

## Challenges Identified
1. **Dynamic Amounts**: Swap outputs affect subsequent operations
2. **Token Approvals**: Need to handle within the bundled transaction
3. **Gas Estimation**: Complex bundled operations need proper estimation
4. **Debugging**: Harder to identify which operation failed in a bundle

## Ready for Implementation
I have completed the onboarding process and understand:
- How the current system works
- What EIP-7702 enables
- How to integrate it into the complex bot
- The benefits and challenges

Next steps would be to start implementing:
1. EIP-7702 transaction builder utilities
2. Implementation contract for futarchy operations
3. Modified buy/sell functions using bundled transactions
4. Integration with the complex bot

## Key Files to Modify
- Create: `src/helpers/eip7702_builder.py`
- Create: `src/arbitrage_commands/buy_cond_eip7702.py`
- Create: `src/arbitrage_commands/sell_cond_eip7702.py`
- Modify: `src/arbitrage_commands/complex_bot.py`
- Create: `contracts/FutarchyBatchExecutor.sol`

The design is complete and I'm ready to begin implementation upon request.
