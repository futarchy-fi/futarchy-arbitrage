# ETH Mainnet + Uniswap V3 Task Index

Each subtask is tracked in its own file with high-detail requirements and minimal scope. Work through them in order:

1. `0_terminology_ground_rules.md` — Token naming, decimal handling, and execution assumptions.
2. `1_discovery_prerequisites.md` — Contract inventory, token metadata, liquidity validation, and infrastructure inputs.
3. `2_config_env.md` — Config schema updates, env template migration, and CLI enhancements.
4. `3_pricing_layer.md` — Pricing helper replacements for conditional, spot, and prediction markets.
5. `4_execution_path.md` — Swap helper builds, multicall upgrades, script changes, and executor contract additions.
6. `5_tooling_funding.md` — Wallet tooling and Supabase/state sync updates.
7. `6_deployment_operations.md` — Deployment workflow, configuration rollout, runbooks, and monitoring.

Keep these files in sync as tasks progress; update individual documents rather than this index for detailed changes.
